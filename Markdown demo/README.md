# Paragraph
First paragraph.

Next paragraph

Third.Notice the blank line between each! That’s the important part.

# Headings
# Chapter 1

## Chapter 1.1
## Chapter 1.2

# Chapter 2

### Uberfancy chapter 2.1.1

# Unnumbered lists
Let’s start a list:
- Item one
- Item two

Another one:
* Part 1
* Part 2

Indeed. It doesn’t matter if you use * or – or +
Just don’t forget a space in between the marker and the actual text.

# Numbered lists
Let’s start a list:
1. Item one
2. Item two


Don’t forget a space after the dot.

# Nested lists
Simply use two spaces before putting the marker down:
* Level 1
  * Level 2
  * Level 2.1
* Level 2
  1. Mixing is fun
  2. Indeed. But don’t forget the space

# Horizontal rule
Only use if you really want a big horizontal line in your tekst:
***

#Blockquotes
> Einstein once said. Put a > in front of each
> line if you wish to quote some one.
> Like this.

Or like Darwin said:
> Put the sign once and the quote will continue untill a new paragraph begins

Like here.

# Emphasis
The third *word* is really important!

And this **word** is even more important!

# Links
A bit harder. 
Click [here](http://www.google.be) to open the google page.

Or with a tooltip. 
Click on [www.google.be](http://google.be “Cool tool tip huh”)

# Images
Just like links, but with an exclamation.
Let’s show a cool picture:
![Greatest teacher alive](timdams.jpg)

# Escaping and literals
Please don’t put this \_word\_ in bold. Just show the underscores as is.

# Code
Cool developer books contain C# code such as:
	
	Console.WriteLine();

Notice that there’s a tab in front


Inline code like this `reset --help` is done with the backtick. Make sure to use the correct one! (alt-gr+7 on my keyboard)

# Useful tools
Editor:
* Notepad or notepad++
* MarkdownPas, WriteMonkey, MarkPad
* Atom
Conversion
* Gitbook
* Pandoc

Have a look at [gitprint.com](http://gitprint.com) for some lazy stuff :)
